# Bloom Stick

The Bloom Stick project is built around the [Attract-Mode](http://attractmode.org/) software by Andrew Mickelson, distributed under license under the terms of the GNU General Public License v3 or later.

Originally, Attract-Mode is a graphical user interface (frontend) developed for Linux (x86, x86-64, ARM, Raspberry Pi), Mac OS X and Windows-based systems. It is optimized for run game emulators such as MAME, MESS and Nestopia, making it ideal for an arcade cabinet.
