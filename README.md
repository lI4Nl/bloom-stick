# Bloom Stick

The Bloom Stick project is built around the Attract Mode software by Andrew Mickelson, distributed under license under the terms of the GNU General Public License v3 or later.

Originally, Attract-Mode is a graphical user interface (frontend) developed for Linux (x86, x86-64, ARM, Raspberry Pi), Mac OS X and Windows-based systems. It is optimized for run game emulators such as MAME, MESS and Nestopia.  

It is intended to be operated with a joystick or gamepad, making it ideal for an arcade cabinet.
