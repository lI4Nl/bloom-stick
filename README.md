# Bloom-Stick
The Bloom Stick project is built around the Attract Mode software. 
by Andrew Mickelson, distributed under license under the terms 
of the GNU General Public License v3 or later.

Originally, Attract-Mode is a graphical user interface (frontend) 
originally developed for Linux (x86, x86-64, ARM, Raspberry Pi), 
Mac OS X and Windows-based systems. It is optimized for 
run game emulators such as MAME, MESS and Nestopia.  

It is intended to be operated with a joystick or gamepad, 
making it ideal for an arcade cabinet.

If you would like to learn more about Attract Mode, you can visit
