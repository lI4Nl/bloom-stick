# Bloom Stick

The Bloom Stick project is built around the [Attract-Mode](http://attractmode.org/) software by Andrew Mickelson, distributed under license under the terms of the GNU General Public License v3 or later.

Originally, Attract-Mode is a graphical user interface (frontend) developed for Linux (x86, x86-64, ARM, Raspberry Pi), Mac OS X and Windows-based systems. It is optimized for run game emulators such as MAME, MESS and Nestopia, making it ideal for an arcade cabinet.

To run the software and games in optimal conditions, Bloom Stick is tested on a mini PC like an Intel Compute Stick device.

## Installation

### Compiling

The Bloom Stick project is a compilation of software built around precompiled binaries of Attract-Mode, no source code modification on the different software is made. 
(these are not the objectives of the project).
