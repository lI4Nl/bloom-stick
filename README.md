# Bloom-Stick
The Bloom Stick project is a front-end interface based on Attract Mode by Andrew Mickelson and exclusively composed of video games and programs that are freely and legally available. Bloom Stick aims to be an accessible one-package solution as well as the first comprehensive collection of games accessible to a broader audience.
